Function g(i,set of parents){
    Set score = 1
    If set of parents is empty
        Nij is the size of entire training set and Sv is entire training set
        Score *= (r_i-1)! / (N_{ij}+r_i-1)!
        For each child instantiation (e.g. 0 and 1)
            Get count of training record subset items (in Sv)
            That will be Nijk (in the case of two instantiations there will be two Nijk’s, and ri = 2)
            Score *= N_{ijk}!
    Else
        Get parental instantiations (e.g. 00,01,10,11)
        For each parental instantiation
            Get the training records that match (Sv)
            Size of that set is Nij
            Score *= (r_i-1)! / (N_{ij}+r_i-1)!
            For each child instantiation (e.g. 0 and 1)
                Get count of training record subset items (in Sv)
                That will be Nijk (in the case of two instantiations there will be two Nijk’s, and ri = 2)
                Score *= N_{ijk}!
